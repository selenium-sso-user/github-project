1
00:00:03,255 --> 00:00:06,970
Git, a distributed source
control repository.

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,400
I tried to picture clusters of
information as they move

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,210
through the file system.

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,820
Were the commit messages
like history books?

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,172
I kept dreaming of
a repository I

6
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:18,210
thought I'd never see.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,205
And then, one day: Git Real.
