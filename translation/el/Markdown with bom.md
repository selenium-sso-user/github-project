# Escaping bug

The string below is a quote that includes a star symbol, escaped.

> Here is escaped star symbol: \* this text should not be in italic \*

This works, but if we additionally put escaped star in a quote, it's rendered incorrectly:

> Here is escaped star symbol within quotes: "\*" this text should not be in italic "\*"
